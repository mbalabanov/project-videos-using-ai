          <p>
            There are many short videos on Youtube that explain and describe
            everyday terms. What if you could create your own explainer videos
            without much effort? I decided to try it myself and made three
            explainer videos in only one day using generally available and cheap
            artificial intelligence tools.
          </p>

          <h2 id="ai-videos-section-1">The Topics for the Explainer Videos</h2>

          <p>
            The first video is about dry cleaning, and the second is about
            "kayfabe," a term from pro wrestling. The third video tries to
            answer whether vomiting is good for you. The videos turned out quite
            all right. They are not sensationally good or inspired, but - you
            know what - they are perfectly serviceable.
          </p>

          <p>
            I made these videos with zero creativity and zero research in record
            time. I did not write any of the scripts myself but used an AI tool
            and only made slight tweaks to the text. I did not narrate the
            voiceovers but used an AI narration reader. I did not shoot a second
            of footage but used cheap stock footage. I did not render a frame of
            3D video but used an automated online service.
          </p>

          <h2 id="ai-videos-section-2">The Tools Used To Create the Videos</h2>
          <p>
            Let's see how I did it and how good these tools are. These are the
            tools I used:
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Jasper AI</strong> at
            <a href="https://www.jasper.ai" target="_blank"
              >https://www.jasper.ai</a
            >
            is an online copywriting assistant. You give it a couple of cues and
            keywords about the topic you want to cover. After a moment, it
            writes a few paragraphs based on your input. If you enter a
            question, then Jasper generates several suggestions. And this is
            exactly what I did. For example, I asked Jasper, "What is Kayfabe?".
            A few moments later, I got a long paragraph with the answer.
          </p>

          <p>
            Next, I wanted to turn this text into a voiceover for the video.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Natural Reader</strong> at
            <a href="https://www.naturalreaders.com" target="_blank"
              >https://www.naturalreaders.com</a
            >
            is a tool for natural-sounding text-to-speech. You feed your text
            into Natural Reader, pick a male or female narrator, and US or UK
            pronunciation. Then Natural Reader generates an MP3 file with the
            voiceover narration. For one of my videos, I picked a male US voice,
            and for the other two, I chose a female voice with British
            pronunciation. Please note that only the slightly more expensive
            commercial plan allows you to use the voiceovers on Youtube.
          </p>

          <p>
            Then I moved on to the footage I needed for the full video. I knew
            that I needed an intro with the titles and an outro with the logo.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Viddyoze</strong> at
            <a href="https://viddyoze.com" target="_blank"
              >https://viddyoze.com</a
            >
            is an automated service for generating 2D and 3D videos like titles,
            intros, logo reveals, credits and outros. You choose from a large
            selection of templates and customize them. Depending on your chosen
            template, you can enter a text, upload a logo and customize the
            colors. Viddyoze then generates the video, and you can download it
            to add it to the video editing application of your choice.
          </p>

          <p>
            I generated the titles for the intros and a standard outro with the
            Eyenessness logo I whipped up in a short time. Now that I knew how
            the video started and ended, I needed some footage to accompany the
            voiceover.
          </p>

          <p>
            There are many stock video services on the web that offer
            high-quality footage. Some, like <em>Adobe Stock,</em>
            <em>Shutterstock</em> and <em>iStock,</em> charge comparatively high
            prices for individual video clips. I knew that I could find similar
            footage at a lower price from the subscription-based services
            <strong>StoryBlocks</strong> at
            <a href="https://www.storyblocks.com" target="_blank"
              >storyblocks.com</a
            >
            and <strong>Videvo.</strong> at
            <a href="https://www.videvo.net" target="https://www.videvo.net"
              >videvo.net</a
            >.
          </p>

          <p>
            In <strong>StoryBlocks,</strong> you enter keywords and are provided
            with a large selection of video clips matching your subject. Most
            stock videos on <strong>StoryBlocks</strong> and
            <strong>Videvo</strong> are suited for business and marketing use.
            They range from slice-of-life like people shopping, talking to each
            other, cooking, or enjoying life. They also cover business meetings
            in conference rooms, people working at computers, on construction
            sites, etc. Both StoryBlocks and Videvo offer competitively priced
            subscriptions that allow you to download as many video clips as you
            need. StoryBlocks has two advantages.
          </p>

          <p>
            On the one hand, you can find stock music and sound effects. On the
            other hand, StoryBlocks integrates seamlessly with LumaFusion, the
            powerful video editing app for iPadOS and iOS. For the kayfabe
            video, I couldn't find suitable footage of pro wrestlers on
            StoryBlocks, so I used Videvo. I picked an intro stinger from the
            music selection on StoryBlocks, some sound effects, and a short
            piece of music for the background score of the narration.
          </p>

          <p>
            Now that I had all the necessary components, I started putting the
            video together.
          </p>

          <h2 id="ai-videos-section-3">Assembling the Pieces</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>LumaFusion</strong> is a powerful and versatile video
            editing app for iOS and iPadOS. It is a delight to use. The app is
            surprisingly reasonably priced, considering how powerful it is. It
            can be found at
            <a href="https://www.luma-touch.com" target="_blank"
              >https://www.luma-touch.com</a
            >
            and LumaFusion provides 80% of the most common features high-priced
            professional video applications like <em>Adobe Premiere</em> and
            Apple's <em>Final Cut Pro</em> offer at a fraction of the price.
            LumaFusion's main feature is non-linear, timeline-based video
            editing. You can combine up to 12 tracks of video and audio. You can
            add titles and overlays, and simple keyframe animations for
            tweening. You can even stabilize shaky videos and use the powerful
            color grading feature to correct the colors and lighting of your
            videos directly from within the application.
          </p>

          <p>
            Using the seamless integration of StoryBlocks with LumaFusion, I
            picked suitable stock footage and dragged it into the timeline. Then
            I added the intro generated from Viddyoze to the start of the video
            and appended the outro. I added the voiceover narration and picked a
            piece of music for the video's estimated final length. And finally,
            I tweaked the size of each clip to match the narration or a
            particular cue in the musical score.
          </p>

          <p>
            The editing usually only took me around half an hour per video. When
            I was done, LumaFusion rendered each video, and I uploaded it to
            Youtube.
          </p>

          <h2 id="ai-videos-section-4">Observations About the Results</h2>
          <p>
            I am pretty happy with the results. AI-based storytelling has
            excellent potential. But as you can see, the available tools already
            provide rather good results with minimal effort. Jasper AI for the
            copywriting and script, Natural Reader for the automated voiceover,
            StoryBlocks and Videvo for stock video footage and music, and a
            video editing suite like LumaFusion.
          </p>

          <p>
            To be fair, only Jasper and Natural Reader use AI. Even the video
            editor and the stock footage sites have some rudimentary logic to
            accelerate your decision-making.
          </p>

          <p>
            There are also other tools that I could have used. For example,
            Speechelo for natural sounding text-to-speech for the voiceover
            narration and even Lumen5 to generate animated presentations based
            on keywords and subject matter.
          </p>

          <p>
            Admittedly, there is much room for improvement, and the final videos
            are too streamlined. They could be more exciting and lack the
            personality to be truly professional. Still, given the minimal cost
            and effort, they communicate the message concisely and effectively.
          </p>

          <p>
            It is still early days. I, for one, can't wait to see how AI tools
            will in future enable me to make videos even faster and better
            videos.
          </p>
